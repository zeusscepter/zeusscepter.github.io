      <p>This site is an ode to grace, peace and blessing and a full-out testament to the grace of my ancestors who watch over and protect; a soul salute to the angels of mercy from the ten directions; a celestrial praise song for the unsung living and transitioned on; there is goodness to bless the mind with if we but take a coolflowing slow down moment to inhale and think on the power of the goodness present in our live that has refreshed and enriched our being and nurtured us beyond belief in this lifetime; This site is the spaces and places dust tracks on a road that my life has journeyed upon. It's all kneaded from and folded into and drawn from a life worth redeeming and living!</p>
