          In 1996 i began volunteering at a senior organization exclusively dedicated to serving the needs of elder people of color. Most of the members reside in New Yorkâ€™s metropolitan area, though other senior members have relocated throughout the country. Nearly all members are from modest-to-low income households; more than 50% are retired; and about 90% identify as black, African American or Caribbean American.
            I was available to provide emotional support and assist in srtucturing quality programming that affirm the lives of this often invisible and marginalized population. Especially the Woodcarving class that was offered. We'd gather weekly and creative elixir would fly...!!! As an ally I committed to honoring and preserving our histories and traditions while reuniting those parts of our selves that have been fragmented by racism and societal ill. We maintain a space, free of discrimination based on age, gender, race, sexuality, spirituality, and ethnic origin. Everyone is welcome. Since I was basically the youngest memeber in the oraganization during my service years, I was asked to be the designated drivers when evnts took place and elders wanted to be safe when drinking. They treated me with such kindness and adoration that it moved me to be there and close in ways I'd never reached with elders in my own family. Truly precious and priceless times. When I think about the goodness in Elders, here's where I go in my mind...</p>
